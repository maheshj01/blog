Hey folks, this is good to see you over my blog, You are here because you always wanted to be here. I know you are looking for something that could help you enrich your life help you go through your circumstances and I hope my blog will help you out through your situations.
I’d like to tell you about The Miraculous Day. The day when your life will take a turn, where you’ll have nothing to worry and your every step will take you to your dream. But before that you’ll have to face the outside world to get yourself on the track and give a turn to your life. And then you’ll start experiencing the magical things God has planned for you, you will overcome every obstacle every situation that comes your way.

Miraculous day is a beginning to your Beautiful life, where every single day would be worth living and full of miracles and Joy. You might not believe in Miracles, but believe me Miracles happen to those who believe in them.

People loose hope from life complaining that life has never been good, never offered a good opportunity, Never been so lucky and some crap views about life but let me tell you “People who kept complaining about life and other things years ago will keep complaining years after”

Show your Gratitude to God, say it with faith “God I Believe in You and Iam Grateful To you for all your offerings”. And most Importantly the words don’t work out, what works out is the feelings behind the words, I call it the World of Feelings because they give a shape to your dreams into the Real World. If you’re really Grateful to God Then He has got the wonderful life for you, you have never imagined.

There is always a Good reason behind every particular situation. God has put failures in your path with the intention to learn from the failures. He will offer you the best of this Universe if you deserve it, if you have worked hard enough for it, if you have learned the enough skills, if you hold enough experience to deserve your dream. When people go through the bad situations they spend so much of there energy in thinking about the bad times, that they can’t see the new opportunities standing in front of them.

They don’t realise that If they use this energy for the doors that has open they could get more than what they’ve lost.

> ”Your Journey towards the success wouldn’t have been more rewarding without the failures, and journey is more rewarding than the reward itself”.

Learn to accept the failure because they made you a bit stronger. If you’ve not given up yet. You will have to develop an attitude to see Good in every situations. You have to accept that everything happens by the will of God and Everything happens For Good, And you have to make yourself Believe that you’ve been made to deserve something Better.

> “I don’t Know who God is, But I Believe there is something greater than Human something Which Lights us with Happiness & Glory and we call Him God”.

The process of Believing to Receiving takes a ample amount of time and this is the best part of the entire process. Because we sometimes make a wrong belief and curse our fate when it comes into the reality. God gives us enough time to rely on our dream to give it a turn and to feel it and then He brings it to the Real World.

> The Biggest Prison people live in is, What others Think…??

But Let me get you clear about this, there is Nothing behind those question marks, The only thing there is your thoughts & their Words.

This is your Life and people have nothing to do with it. You are positive and rest 99.999% in this world is negative, which is trying to push you down from getting yourself to the fullest potential. Which is erasing the creativity within you. All I want you to do is, If you have dream then don’t declare it to the outside world unless you accomplish it.

> Principle- The thing you wish to achieve also wishes to achieve you.

Here is the simple way to test the Principle, Tonight when you Go to Bed Visualise about the thing you wish to achieve it may be a smart phone you’d love to have, a car you’d like to drive, a sports bike you would like to ride, the gaming console you would like to experience, the person you would like to meet, A bungalow you would like to Live in, or even small things a cup of coffee you would like to have with, or the party wear you would love to have, anything…….

And next day I guarantee you, you will encounter it somewhere with the precise shape and colour you’ve imagined.

Remember-When I say the word Visualise it does not just mean to form a picture in front of your eyes, it means to Live your dream for that Moment.

Don’t ever forget that there is no Obstacle any situation or any circumstances in this entire Universe which you cannot face. God called you The Masterpiece the best creature ever made with a Unique Identity with a Unique Ability and endless possibilities. He has Got the Perfect plan for you, If you hold the abilities to Achieve your dream Believe me God will put you to the right place to the right time and to the right degree, And No one can Stop You.

**God Bless You**
