#### It is lack of motivation!

I believe you need motivation even to walk couple of steps, you need enough motivation to do every single thing and to accomplish it, Motivation in the sense implies confidence when you are confident to do a certain job, the level of confidence defines your swiftness and quality of work being done. these words may sound a little mumbo Jumbo but once you realize it the results will be life changing.
We live in the world where people will push you down every time you try to rise up its not physically but mentally of course, because theres a race with the world may it be in terms of humans or rest of the species on the planet everyone wants a control over the other, but if you want change you need to ignore and do what is right and work with 0% expectation and ultimately what matters is How you react to it.
