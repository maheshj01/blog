Not only bitcoin but 90% of the alts are down, what usually happens is when bitcoin goes up most of the alts go down,but the situation is kind of different this morning .

lot of people think China and North Korea must be the reason behind putting the market down,
but seeing the market situation it seems like what happened is the panic selling.This is what I think, In last two months the cryptocurrency market has seen a massive rise this probably happened because a lot of new investors rushed into the crypto world after the news( bitcoin reached 10 k ,11k crosses alltime high) flied everywhere,so with new investors came a massive cash inflow and these gave pump to the bitcoin and it reached nearly 19k,but the investors may have not studied the bitcoin past properly and as a result they couldnt accept a little fall and must have led to panic selling,
this is what I think must have happened but No one can be certain about the cause,
but I actually see this is as a price correction and new investors must realize that they need to be very patient and see cryptocurrencies as a longtime return, and if they can't accept a little correction in the price then they don't certainly deserve high returns.

## Heres why this isn't a bubble

if we look at the past history January hasn't been a good time for bitcoin, and it seems to follow the trend that it will likely go to the moon before the end of the year and see a massive downfall in January.

so basically guys don't panic and sell ,make a mindset to see cryptocurrencies as long term bull specially bitcoin and in these situations you shouldn't be selling instead follow the opposite trend, buy more take this as a bitcoin 50% off sale cash in and buy more, and always remember what goes up and falls down will come back to its previous state again this holds true specially incase of bitcoin, if you look at the graph of bitcoin from past 6 years everytime there was a fall bitcoin came back to its state and it certainly will.And we can also consider this as a strategy of massive investors but no one can actually be certain about it. A similar tweet came from from john McAfee

> A past 6 years graph of bitcoin says No matter what happens, Bitcoin has only one way to go and that is Up
