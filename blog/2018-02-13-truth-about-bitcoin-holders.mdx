Last year bitcoin had a phenomenal run leading up to its all-time high of $19,600 per BTC this past mid-December. The price over the past few weeks had since dipped to a low of $5,900 on Monday, February 5, losing close to 65% of its value in a short period. By the way the ‘richest bitcoin holders’ have gained thousands more BTC taking full advantage of these significant price variances.
**Do you know  the top 100 people in this world hold 3,132,269 BTC ($27,345,470,449 USD) thats 18.59% of Total coins available, It's not a secret that they use their assets to ‘move the market.**

The **surprising** thing is, According to data collected from [Bitinfocharts.com](https://Bitinfocharts.com) most of the 100 richest BTC addresses haven’t lost any money during the last 65 percent dip — In fact, their stacks of BTC increased exponentially.

Take for instance the owner of the most substantial amount of bitcoins located in one address which currently holds 167,000 BTC

In 2017 there have been six ‘major’ corrections that have seen BTC lose over 30 percent or more of its value, and this particular whale has gained more funds every single time. heres the stastic about his assets on his wallet.

 So Basically whenever theres a downfall or bitcoin fell to its feet People sold their assets in loss while the massive holders invested more, ultimately winners were always the whales. The good news is While these whales have accumulated more this gives us an indication that the massive investors can see a bright future of bitcoin. bitcoin will no doubt be back to its feet and will start to fly and will break the records by the end of this year. And its worth learning that **Winners will be those who will hold for long ** and this holds true everywhere.

Thank you for reading with me and I hope this post is useful!
