Its 7:00 in the Morning here, As I scroll through my Instagram I see  someone posts a photo of a Legendary actress Sridevi ,I just liked the pic and scroll forward without reading the caption and as I scroll I see an another picture this gives me a thought is it her birthday Today or anything special about her and the caption says "**Legendary No More**" .
I don't know why it feels really sad to see someone pass away who I have no relation with,

I always had this thought in my Mind **what happens when someone passes away..** and with this absolute shocking news this thought comes to my mind again.Hundreds and Thousands of people are born everyday and with the same ratio People tend to live the earth. And the mystery remains Unsolved what happens to people who die,Do they ever Regret to have left their Loved ones, Will they have that immense power to give their mind a thought,to think and feel like you are alive.
As I search through the internet I realize this question remains unanswered,No One really knows what happens when we die - some believe in an afterlife, some believe in reincarnation and others simply think nothing happens. You just die. Thatâ€™s it end of life.

I saw this picture over the internet and this image seems to convey spiritual beings having a human Experience,well finally those are thoughts of a human being.

And the best answer to this Question what happens when we die is the answer by Keanu Reeves.

 When I look into my past I realize **"Good people tend To live the Earth so Early". **We are planning for the Mars, We are developing robots to who work like human, think like human and much better, Human race is developing so much faster but its quite devastating to see people die of little accidents and diseases, We have progressed in all the fields but we have not yet come over a solution to overcome fatal accidents, Also we cannot deny the fact that death is unevitable and thats the ultimate truth of life.
