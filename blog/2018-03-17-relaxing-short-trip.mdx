Yesterday was all about visiting a place away from the Hometown,No it wasn't a holiday nor we were on a Vacation but we wanted to spend some time to relax and have some fun and relieve our stress ,
I haven't been doing much good in my academics,its not that I didn't try but things didn't worked out for me,I went into a passive state,I was about to give up,I felt like I am done may be I can't take it anymore,I spent hours working but wasn't as productive as expected, I was never so depressed as I was until yesterday but then I gave it a thought

"If I were about to give up in the middle of the Journey,I wouldn't have travelled this far "

It was more Important for me to keep moving and to be more positive,I knew that Negative thoughts will create more uncertainty and will leave me restless and will do no good.So I was like I wanted to forget all about these stuffs and leave them at their place,I know when I come back they will remain the same but I knew it too that once I shake of all my fears and stress,I will have a different view to face them and Make a new Beginning.

I and my friends planned a short trip to a nearby place 100 kms away from the Hometown to Chakur,well known for the water Park but it has much more for people than just a water park,We started our journey around 8:00 in the Morning,On a pleasant and soothing morning with a cool wind passing by

            Breakfast at a Restaurant that serves all vegetarians,we started by taking
            a light breakfast and it was a "Dahi Dhapate" served with a "chatni" thats
            what they call it dahi which means a curd and dhapate well if you are
            familiar with parathaas a kind of similar to that.We were served in a huge
            plate it was quite good, well I just forgot to take a shot But fortunately
            I found it from a a friend it looks something like this`}

After having a breakfast we started off and in an around 3 hours we were at our Destination,I
had visited this place back then 4-5 years ago and I passed by every place here my
memories came alive, And this place is still beautiful with lots of greenery,but
this time I didn't find much of a crowd though but the calmness here still reverberates
my mind,its a good place to come by to relax and experience the serenity.

we were few minutes early at the water park ,so we just took a walk to watch the scenery around and as we move ahead we see a blue Mermaid hopefully it was built for the scenery years ago and it's still quite well maintained at the entrance .

And after Couple of hours in the water park we took a shower and left out and we took the lunch and our next stop was the Amusement park near by,As I said earlier Chakur isn't just about water park there's an Amusement Park too,and We headed towards the Amusement park.

At the Entrance of the Amusement park we took the Mini Train,After spending hours in the water park we were too much Exhausted but the train was quite relieving.

After we left the train we reached at the Dash Car and Dashed each other like hell lol : )
which hardly lasted for 2-3 minutes.

we rode on the Revolving tower and also took the camel ride ,there was a little girl probably 2-3 years old was quite brave to join us on the revolving tower which must be atleast 20 fts high.

With the camel Ride ended our Journey,but for me the Journey has actually began I see this as a New Beginning, this reminds me an Inspiring words from Joel Osteen.

> Let go of yesterday. Let today be a new beginning and be the best that you can, and you'll get to where God wants you to be.
