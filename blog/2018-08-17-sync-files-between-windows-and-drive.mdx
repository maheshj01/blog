hey guys welcome back in this post I will show you How you can sync files in betwen your computer and Google Drive automatically. so for this you will need a small tool called backup and sync,I have been using this tool for almost one year and I've found it really helpful so I thought to share it with you guys.

so open up your browser and search for backup and sync,

you should see this first link from google just go to that link and you will see the download option it's a very small tool basically less than 2 megabytes.

I have already downloaded the tool on my computer so I wont be downloading it again once you have downloaded the tool install and run it and you should see this Google sign in screen, so sign in with your Google account

once you have successfully signed in with your google account you need to choose a folder on your computer that you would want to be backed up automatically to the Google Drive.

you can see here I have desktop documents and pictures I don't want in all of those to be backed up automatically, so I'm just unchecking these things I want my custom folders stored on the desktop you can see syncit folder here I want this folder to be automatically backed up,

so I'll choose this folder here once I select this folder you can see here I have it will validate the folder and and once its validated and down here we have an option for photos and videos,

and its about whether we want to upload with the compresed size or with the original quality we can also choose to store our photos on google photos by ticking this option I'll just hit next

and then we need to choose the folders on a Google Drive that we want to sync with the local Drive.

make sure to tick this option and by default it will be checked I don't want all the contents on myGoogle Drive to be synced automatically so I'll just uncheck that option here, you can see that I don't have anything on my Google Drive so it's showing no folders in my drive and I'll just check the second option here.

so I'll just hit start and it'll say that you are merging with Google Drive content

![Screenshot (23).png](<https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmbd3AxftxCzihWtRoXPWocWnEBdHwZvvjxPjvGoNzRFq8/Screenshot%20(23).png>)

so just click continue you'll see that google drive folder is created on my desktop you can see down here below it is preparing to sync these are some of my contents of my Google Drive folder that have been recently synced from Google Drive

and it says updated just now and you can also see that it is syncing one of two it is actually uploading my contents of sync-it folder to the Google Drive you can see these are the contents the same contents that are being uploaded to my Google Drive I'll show you these folders in my Google Drive actually you can see this is my drive this is the same folder as mydrive on my desktop let's put these two windows side by sides so you will get a clear idea what I am talking about so these two folders are the same actually one on the cloud and one on my computer,so any changes I make to these any of the folder those will be reflectd to another folder
