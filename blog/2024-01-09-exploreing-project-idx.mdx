#### Google's new in-browser IDE for full-stack development

I have been using ![Project IDX](https://idx.dev) for a month now and I find it very helpful, I have always felt the need for it. Now I no longer need to carry my laptop with me, and can continue my work exactly where I left off on any machine. You can run large projects right in your browser with the same experience as you would, locally on your machine anytime, anywhere on the go with IDX. For those who are not aware

> Project IDX is an experimental initiative from Google to do full-stack development in a browser-based workspace. It is powered by [virtual machines](https://cloud.google.com/workstations?hl=en) running in Google Cloud.

It comes with a bunch of workspace templates for different frameworks for building web apps and It also supports building apps with Flutter (more on that ahead) or you can also import your existing project from a repository. A total of two workspaces can be created as of today.

Let's take a closer look to experience all the cool features IDX offers firsthand. Once we choose to create a web app, IDX offers starter project templates of the most popular web frameworks like React, Angular, Svelte,  and more.

Once the project is created, you will find a familiar interface, because IDX uses [Monaco Editor](https://github.com/microsoft/monaco-editor), the same code editor that powers VS Code. This means you get access to all extensions and customizations VSCode provides out of the box right in your browser. The editor experience is extremely smooth and hard to distinguish whether you are developing locally on your machine or in the browser.

To quickly run a demo app I took the very popular [matrix animation art from codepen](https://codepen.io/yuanchuan/pen/YoqWeR) for a quick test and you can see how smoothly it renders the output also the response time for the preview to update is instant when you change the code.

Every project in the IDX workspace requires a monospace.json (created by default for a new project) file at the root of your project in order to launch a virtual device. Here's a [sample monospace.json](https://pastelog.netlify.app/logs/c18e0e60-aa42-11ee-bebc-4998c6ff0e28) file with running android/ios/web previews. One you create that file with the previews configuration you need to hard reset IDX (ctrl/cmd + shift + p -> IDX: hard reset)to start the preview with the new configuration

All commands of IDX can be accessed from the command palette by pressing ctrl/cmd + shift + p

#### IDX AI Assistant

Now that AI has become part of our lives, AI code assistant is crucial to any modern IDE, IDX Workspace also has an AI to assist you with your code powered by [codey](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/generative-ai/code/code-models-overview) and [palm 2](https://ai.google/discover/palm2/). It can do a lot of things for you like adding comments to a selected piece of code, generating code, explaining code, and much more.

It also has this small yet sweet feature where it inserts the generated code in your file at the position of the cursor.

#### Emulators for Flutter

One of the most important things when developing mobile apps is having a virtual device this is what separates IDX from other cloud IDEs, the ability to run virtual devices for Android and IOS right in your browser. This is a huge deal, considering the complexities involved in getting the virtual devices running and the amount of resources these devices consume.

### Devtools

Development is not merely a code editor it comes with a lot of overhead like the ability to use plugins to preview and test your app in a virtual environment. 

Some of the improvements/issues that I think are missing or require a fix
Android emulator should be resizable to have more space for the editor
Loading the IOS simulator sometimes takes a couple of tries
Configuration for existing projects should either add a monospace.json file or the user should be prompted to add one
