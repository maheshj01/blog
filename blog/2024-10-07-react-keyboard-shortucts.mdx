ust as each piano key corresponds to a unique sound, the keys on a keyboard can be mapped to trigger specific UI components. When developing desktop or web applications, we often need to capture keyboard events to perform certain actions. Keyboard shortcuts provide quick access to features that would otherwise require multiple keystrokes and mouse clicks. I encountered a similar need while building Pastelog, an AI-powered note-taking app.

In the world of great product experiences, if you are not adding a keyboard shortcut at appropriate places you are hurting the user experience. Wonder how?

Take Google Search as an example. It has a ‘Google Search’ button, but I bet 90% of people will press ‘Enter’ instead of clicking the button. Why? Because it’s a product standard — it’s ingrained in our subconscious to hit ‘Enter’ to submit input.
